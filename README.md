# Computational-Physics2021
This repository contains my Homeworks for the Computational Physics course at the Sharif University of Technology in the Fall 2021 Semester, instructed by Prof. Ejtehadi. There are reports for each homework that describe the problems and accomplished solutions. Also, according to the detailed comments in codes, you can easily follow through with each algorithm.
